# üìÇ Media Organizer

**Media Organizer** is a small utility to help tidy up your collection of photos, videos, and other media files. If you've ever had a folder full of files like `IMG_1234.JPG` or `VID_20220101.mp4` and wished they were neatly organized ‚Äî this tool is for you.

It scans your media files and organizes them into folders based on their metadata (like date taken). Simple idea, but super handy in practice.

üéâ **Media Organizer is now available on the Microsoft Store!**

Simplify your media file management experience by installing directly from the [Microsoft Store](<LINK_TO_STORE>). Get automatic updates, seamless integration, and an enhanced user experience.

## How to build the app?
1. Clone the repository to your local machine [How To](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository)
2. Install .NET 9 if you don't have it yet [Download .NET 9](https://get.dot.net).
3. Open the terminal / console window
4. Decide how you'd like to run the app (Command line utility or the Desktop app - see the next chapters).
5.**If you'd like to use the command-line utility**, navigate to the MediaOrganizer.CLI folder in the terminal
6.**If you'd like to use the desktop app**, navigateto the MediaOrganizer folder in the terminal
7. Run `dotnet build` command

This will build the project and produce the app under the `bin/debug` folder of the project that you built.

## How to use it?

The app comes in two forms (for now): a command-line utility and a desktop application to run on a Windows PC.

## Command line utility
The MediaOrganizer.CLI project will build the command-line utillity that you can use for organizing your media library.
Here is the quick guide for the options you can use:

![Media Organizer screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1429c4cb-9b36-4631-87a3-e96e3c70cd70)

- **Source Root**: Folder where your messy media lives  
- **Destination Root**: Folder where the organized media will live
- **Movies root folder name**: The name of the root folder under which the photos will be organized
- **Photos root folder name**: The name of the root folder under which the photos will be organized
- **Destination Pattern**: Customize your folder structure (e.g. by year, month, day)  
- **Delete on Move**: If checked, files will be *moved* (not copied)  
- **Skip Existing Files**: Prevent overwriting if files already exist  

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Organizes files using metadata (date taken, created date)
- Customizable folder structure using tokens like `{Year}`, `{Month}`, `{Day}`, `{MonthName}`
- Supports both **copy** and **move** modes
- Option to skip already existing files
- Lightweight and easy to use

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Download and build the project:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mkArtak/mediaorganizer.git
   cd mediaorganizer
   dotnet build
   ```

2. Run the app:
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project MediaOrganizer
   ```

3. Fill in the fields in the GUI, click **Start**, and let it do its thing!

## üõ† Destination Pattern Tokens

The media will be organized under two root folders (Movies and Photos), following a pattern defined by the user.
The default pattern has the following form: `{Year}/{MonthName}/{Year}-{Month}-{Day}`
You can use the following tokens to define your folder structure:

| Token         | Description                                       |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `{Year}`      | Year media was taken (..., 2010, 2025, ...)       |
| `{Month}`     | Month (01, 02, ... 12)                            |
| `{MonthName}` | Full month name (January, February, ... December) |
| `{Day}`       | Day of the month (01, 02, ... 31)                 |

**Example**  
`{Year}/{MonthName}/{Year}-{Month}-{Day}`  
would create folders like:  
`2023/June/2023-06-15/IMG_1234.JPG`
