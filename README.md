# üìÇ Media Organizer

**Media Organizer** is a small utility I built to help tidy up your collection of photos, videos, and other media files. If you've ever had a folder full of files like `IMG_1234.JPG` or `VID_20220101.mp4` and wished they were neatly organized ‚Äî this tool is for you.

It scans your media files and organizes them into folders based on their metadata (like date taken). Simple idea, but super handy in practice.

Here‚Äôs what the app looks like:

- **Source Root**: Folder where your messy media lives  
- **Destination Root**: Folder where the organized magic happens
- **Movies root folder name**: The name of the root folder under which the photos will be organized
- **Photos root folder name**: The name of the root folder under which the photos will be organized
- **Destination Pattern**: Customize your folder structure (e.g. by year, month, day)  
- **Delete on Move**: If checked, files will be *moved* (not copied)  
- **Skip Existing Files**: Prevent overwriting if files already exist

## üõ† Destination Pattern Tokens

The media will be organized under two root folders (Movies and Photos), following a pattern defined by the user.
The default pattern has the following form: `{Year}/{MonthName}/{Year}-{Month}-{Day}`
You can use the following tokens to define your folder structure:

| Token         | Description                                       |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `{Year}`      | Year media was taken (..., 2010, 2025, ...)       |
| `{Month}`     | Month (01, 02, ... 12)                            |
| `{MonthName}` | Full month name (January, February, ... December) |
| `{Day}`       | Day of the month (01, 02, ... 31)                 |

**Example**  
`{Year}/{MonthName}/{Year}-{Month}-{Day}`  
would create folders like:  
`2023/June/2023-06-15/IMG_1234.JPG`
