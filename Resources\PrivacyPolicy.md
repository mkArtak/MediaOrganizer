Privacy Policy
Effective Date: 13 April 2025

Media Organizer is a lightweight utility designed to help users organize their media files by moving them from a source folder to a destination folder based on user-defined rules. This privacy policy outlines how the application handles your data.

1. Data Collection
Media Organizer does not collect, store, transmit, or process any personal or private user data. The application operates entirely on your local machine and does not interact with external servers or services.

2. How Media Organizer Works
The utility performs file operations only on folders explicitly specified by the user.

It moves or copies media files (e.g., photos, videos) from the selected source folder to a destination folder.

If the user opts in, files from the source folder may be deleted after being copied to the destination folder.

No external access to your files or metadata is made at any time.

3. No Network Communication
Media Organizer does not require or initiate any internet connection. It does not send or receive any data over the internet or local network.

4. Permissions
Media Organizer only accesses files and folders that the user explicitly selects. It does not request or use elevated permissions outside of what is necessary to perform local file operations.

5. Third-Party Services
Media Organizer does not use or integrate with any third-party services, analytics tools, or advertising platforms.

6. Security
As a local utility, all file operations occur within your own system environment. We recommend that users always download the utility from trusted sources to avoid tampered versions.

7. Changes to this Policy
This policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be posted in the official repository or distribution channel. Continued use of the application after changes are made constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
